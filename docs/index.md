# Recap Time Squad Policies

Welcome to our policies site, where we host most of our policies publicly in one place.
Use the navigation menu on the left (or by tapping the hambugger icon) or the search bar/icon
to navigate around.

## Changelog and previous versions

This site only hosts the latest versions of our policies, but you may look at [commit history]
in the GitLab repository.

For the changelog, we're working on that soon for most of our policies to provide
a more summarized version of commit logs and `git diff`s.

* We are formally accepting [Hack Club Code of Conduct] in addition to our own
[Community Code of Conduct]
