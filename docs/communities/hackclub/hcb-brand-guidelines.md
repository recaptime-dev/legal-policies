# HCB Brand Guidelines

__**Last updated**__: 2024-12-12

This page is adopted from [the official Brand Guidelines](https://hcb.hackclub.com/branding) for
HCB / Hack Club for the use of HCB badges at [lorebooks.wiki Badges API] and our use of them
when mentioning our fiscal sponsorship status.

[lorebooks.wiki Badges API]: https://badges.api.lorebooks.wiki/docs

## The HCB Name

When using or mentioning HCB, please make sure to:

* Capitalize every letter of HCB
* Refrain from adding/removing additional characters and words (e.g. 'Hack Club HCB')
* Refrain from using their previous name, "Hack Club Bank". (tl;dr: legal reasons relating to how to use the word `bank`)

**As a reminder, HCB is a fiscal host, not a bank!** They use [Column] to programmatically manage our organization's funds through a “restricted fund”—a privatized section of these bank accounts for our team only—is created for our organization through the platform. They also use [Stripe Issuing](https://stripe.com) for the virtual team cards to spend on expenses related to our work.

### Legal Names

When mentioning HCB in legal situtations, use either one of these:

* HCB, a project by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club)
* The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club).

We recommend linking them to <https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship>, alongside mentioning its non-profit status, as noted below.

## Mentioning our fiscal sponsorship (for squad members and community maintainers)

As a open-source organization fiscally sponsored through HCB,
the following templates can be included on any correspondence, websites,
marketing, etc. Should you customize them please make sure it clearly shares that
we're fiscally sponsored by HCB. When in doubt, chime into [our issue tracker for HCB](https://issues.recaptime.dev/p/HCB/new?youtrack=true) or
email `hcb@hackclub.com` with CCing `ajhalili2006@crew.recaptime.dev`.
