# Conflict of Interest Policy

_**Last updated**: 2024-05-09, adopted from <https://boardable.com/resources/conflict-of-interest-policy/#template>_

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to protect the interests of Recap Time Squad by:
(a) preventing the personal interest of the Board, Employees, and Independent Contractors
from interfering with their duties to the organization and (b) avoiding any unethical financial,
professional, or political gain on the part of such individuals. The intent of this policy is to
supplement, not replace, any applicable federal, state, or local laws regarding conflicts of interest.

## Persons Concerned

This statement applies to Board Members, Officers, and all Employees who can
influence the governance and actions of Recap Time Squad. This includes anyone who makes financial decisions, might be referred to as “management personnel,” or have proprietary information regarding Recap Time Squad.

## Procedures

1. **Duty to Disclose** - Each Member, Director, Officer, Employee, and any
other Interested Person is under an obligation to disclose the existence or
potential existence of a Conflict of Interest as it arises.

2. **Investigating Conflicts** - When a potential Conflict of Interest is disclosed,
the Governing Board will then provide the individual with an opportunity to
disclose all material facts. The Board will collect all pertinent information
and question the involved parties. If it turns out that a conflict does not
exist, the inquiry will be documented but no further action will be taken.

3. **Addressing a Conflict of Interest** -  If the Board determines that a
conflict of interest exists, they will take the appropriate actions to
address the conflict. This may include (but not be limited to): (a) prohibiting
any Interested Parties from voting on any matter related to said Conflict of
Interest or (b) terminating employment with Recap Time Squad. 

Affected parties both within and outside of Recap Time Squad, including
shareholders, directors, employees, and independent contractors, will be
notified. If the Conflict of Interest in question involves a member of the Board,
that individual will be excused from deliberations.

4. **Disciplinary Action** - All conflicts of interest will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis. The board has full discretion to deem what disciplinary
action is appropriate and necessary for disclosed conflicts of interest.

If the governing officers reasonably believe a member or staff member failed
to disclose an existing or possible Conflict of Interest, it shall inform the
individual of the rationale for such belief and grant the individual an
opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose the Conflict of Interest.

After hearing the individual’s response and investigating further as warranted by the circumstances, the governing officers may take appropriate disciplinary action, including removal from the position at the organization.

5. **Notice of Annual Statements**
Every Member, Director, Officer, Employee, and any other Interested Person must sign a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Statement upon said individual’s term of office, employment, or other relationship with Recap Time Squad and must do so annually. Failure to sign does not nullify the policy.

## Acknowledgment

By signing, the individual named below understands what constitutes a Conflict of Interest and understands the procedure for addressing them with Recap Time Squad, including their duty to disclose any known or potential conflicts of interest.

The signee agrees to abide by the procedures set forth by this policy for the duration of their relationship with Recap Time Squad.
