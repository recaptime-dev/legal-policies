# Staff Code of Conduct

```{admonition} This policy is currently a working draft.
:class: warning

We're actively editing this page on its development branch on GitLab, so
please treat this as interim policy while working to finalize it in near
future.
```

As a community maintainer or squad member, you should be a example of not only following our
community code of conduct, but also follow our staff-specific code of conduct.

## Using a `crew.recaptime.dev` address

Your use of your `crew.recaptime.dev` address (as well as its Staff SSO account through
Microsoft Entra ID and/or Google Workspace/Cloud Identity) is governed by our [SSO ToS][sso-tos].

## Harassment, Bullying and Discrimination

Any violations relating to harassment, bullying and discrimination against and/or
relating to protected classes (as defined in the community code of conduct) by
a staff member will impose heavy sanctions compared to regular community members.
