# CCoC Enforcement Guidelines

This document applies to both squad members, community maintainers in open-source projects,
and moderators in chatrooms (particularly our Zulip Cloud organization).

## General

We follow the general advice on the version of Contributor Convenant our current code of
conduct were adopted, alongside Mozilla's diversity and inclusion guidelines, with some
adjustments specific to our community and internal spaces.

## Application of Consequence Ladder

### Recommendations

They're not treated as violations, although we'll log the case as informational
internally.

### Warning (either simple or formal)

Either the mod team, the project leadership or the squad leads should privately
provide a written warning regarding the violation, along with clarity of violation
and consequences of continued behavior. This should be apply to ALL ladders of
enforcement.

If this is their first formal warning, evaluate their access to internal/sensitive content
within Recap Time Squad and consider temporarily revoking their NDA access.

### Mandatory Cool-off Period

This is somewhere between an formal warning and a temporary ban within the Community CoC,
but in this case, we require the violator to take mandatory time-off/cool-off, ranging from
a few weeks to 3-6 months on case-by-case basis.

If this level of enforcement is used the second time, revoke dev/maintainer/moderator access
if any, including temporarily suspending Staff SSO account access. For the third time, block
or deactivate their accounts, alongside thier NDA access, during the extended ban.

### Project/Area-Specific and Permanent Bans

```{admonition} Bans and blocks should be only used as last resort.
:class: warning

While it is still possible to appeal an moderation action involving bans, once the squad leads upheld
the ban decision, it is cannot be reversed unless the ban was happened in bad faith or human error.
```

## Enforcement on Fediverse

Enforcing the community code of conduct on the fediverse is different due to
federated nature of the network.
