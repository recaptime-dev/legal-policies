# Guidelines in enforcing Community Code of Conduct

This document applies to both squad members, community maintainers in open-source projects,
and moderators in chatrooms (particularly our Zulip Cloud organization).

## General

We follow the general advice on the version of Contributor Convenant our current code of
conduct were adopted.

## Application of Consequence Ladder into Recap Time Squad's

### Warning (either simple or formal)

Either the mod team, the project leadership or the squad leads should privately
provide a written warning regarding the violation, along with clarity of violation
and consequences of continued behavior.

If this is their first formal warning, evaluate their access to internal/sensitive content
within Recap Time Squad and consider temporarily revoking their NDA access.

### Mandatory Cool-off Period

This is somewhere between an formal warning and a temporary ban within the Community CoC,
but in this case, we require the violator to take mandatory time-off/cool-off, ranging from
a few weeks to 3-6 months on case-by-case basis.

If this level of enforcement is used the second time, revoke dev/maintainer/moderator access
if any, including temporarily suspending Staff SSO account access. For the third time, block
or deactivate their accounts, alongside thier NDA access, during the extended ban.

### Project/Area-Specific Bans

### Permanent Ban

TBD

## Enforcement on Fediverse
