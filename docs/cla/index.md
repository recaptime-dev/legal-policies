# Contributor License Agreements

```{admonition} RecapTime.dev CLAs are currently experimental
:class: warning

Although they are technically production-ready, we are still ironing out
the required infrastructure and other things for implementation of CLA.
We intend to only require CLAs on projects with copyleft licenses (mostly
the GPL family of licenses, particularly the AGPL) following
[Element's lead on their Matrix homeserver implementations](https://element.io/blog/element-to-adopt-agplv3/).
```

These legal documents describe about our contributor license agreements within
our open-source projects, including any projects who adopt them in the future.

By default, we require users to sign-off their commits per [the Developer Certificate of Origin](./dco.md)
to simplify the contribution process. Although we also have Individual and Entity CLAs based off the [FSFE]'s
[Fiduciary License Agreement 2.0][FLA-2.0] and maintaining a FAQ page to help ease some concerns,
we're still limit their use
