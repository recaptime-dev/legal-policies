# Contributor License Agreements

These legal documents describe about our contributor license agreements within
our open-source projects, including any projects who adopt them in the future.

By default, we require users to sign-off their commits per [the Developer Certificate of Origin](./dco.md) to simplify the contribution process. Although we also have Individual and Entity CLAs based off the [FSFE]'s
[Fiduciary License Agreement 2.0][FLA-2.0], alongside maintaining a FAQ page to help ease some concerns.

[FLA-2.0]: https://fsfe.org/activities/fla/fla.en.html
