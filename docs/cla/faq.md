# Frequently Asked Questions about Recap Time Squad DCO and CLA

## Developer Certificate of Origin

### How this work?

In DCO setup we follow a simple 'inbound=outbound' contribution model which simplify the process for anyone
while the FLA setup allows us to easily relicense contributions to any open-source [^1] license(s) as we see fit (though we may contact you privately if we want to use it internally)
at expense of going legalese.

[^1]: as approved by [our OSS licensing policy](../opensource/licensing-policy.md)

### Why I need to sign-off my commits? I also signed the Individual/Entity CLA too.

## Contributor Agreements

### How this work?

The Fiduciary License Agreement technically work like a traditional copyright assignment agreement, but with a special clause against
relicensing into proprietary one to prevent situtations like Elastic and more recently HashiCorp, unless we have direct permission from the Contributor as a original copyright holder before the transfer.

After signing, maintainers/copyright holders reciprocally grants the Contributor a non-exclusive worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable licence to same extent as it was originally transferred from the Contributor.

### Do I require to sign the CLA?

Signing the CLA alongside the DCO is recommended, although we do not force anyone to sign it alone.

### Under the Fiduciary Licence Agreement, who are considered as and can be a Trustee?

**TL;DR**: We mostly consult the `AUTHORS` file in the source directory to determine who's the copyright holder in each project. If that file doesn't exist, we follow the procedures stated below.

In officially-maintained projects from Recap Time Squad, the core team and community members who are chosen as copyright holders are the Trustees
alongside [our leadership council (collectively called "Squad Leads")][squad-leads] and [legal team][legal].

[squad-leads]: https://recaptime.eu.org/governance/teams/squad-leads
[legal]: https://recaptime.eu.org/governance/teams/legal

For community-maintained projects under our namespace(s), including those we adopt, we tend to err on the side of community maintainers unless they need our assistance.
