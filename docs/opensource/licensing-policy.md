# Open-source licensing policy

```{admonition} Policy being developed in the public
:class: warning

This policy is a working public draft as part of to-be-exist Recap Time Squad Improvement Proposal.
```

```{admonition} Too Long; Didn't Read
:class: note

When picking a license for new (or existing) project, choose OSI-approved license for
both maximum compatibility and to lessen the burden of other people when reviewing your
project's legal side. The use of open-core/source-only licenses such as SSPL and BUSL
ARE STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED within Recap Time Squad, unless cleared by our legal team.

We recommend the following licenses, depending on your project's situtation:

* [CC-BY-SA-4.0] for documentation and media ONLY
* [MPL-2.0], [GPL-3.0] or [AGPL-3.0] if you need copyleft (arranged from weak to strongest)
* [MIT] if you want permissive and simple

When in doubt, ask your contributors for advice. And since changing the license in open-source
projects is compilcated without amending our [CLA](../cla/index) for automatic copyright assignment
(which some open-source maintainers think it's worst than relicensing to non-OSI approved licenses),
it better to decide it during the early days of your project.

Our licensing policy for open-source projects is simple: as long as it OSI-approved, we can allow it to exist within our namespace(s).
