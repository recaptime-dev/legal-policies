# Recap Time Squad Policies

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/recaptimedev-legal-policies/badge/?version=latest)](https://policies.recaptime.eu.org/?badge=latest&style=flat-square)
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg?style=flat-square)](./docs/code-of-conduct/index.md)

These policies apply across both our public and internal spaces, published online
for transparency. While they're currently public drafts, we'll work behind the scenes
to finalize them for legal review and eventually full enforcement.

## Why we publish them here?

Weâ€™ve published our terms and conditions on GitHub so that you can more easily how our policy has
changed over time, including diffs of specific updates.

## When does Recap Time Squad update these policies?

We'll update them as needed, but not as frequent as how we do commits here on `main` branch.
(The privacy policy, terms of service, code of conducts require 30-daay waiting period after
being merged to main branch alongside mandatory notification of changes.)

## Getting notified about changes

You can either [watch our GitLab project on mau.dev][notifications-project-lab] for high-traffic
notifications like commits and CI or subscribe to our mailing list at sourcehut for changelogs
(coming soon).

If we have your email address on file since you're using our online services, you'll be receiving a email
from the address `legal-changelog@noreply.recaptime.eu.org` about upcoming policy changes.
